Research Projects
======

RNA-mediated gene regulation:
•	Discovery of transcriptional active RNAs
•	Genome-wide investigation of RNA binding protein cooperation and competition 
•	Discovery and characterization of functional long non-coding RNAs in diseases
•	Explorations of evolution and adaptive regulation by testis-specific hairpin RNA-target interaction networks across insect genomes
•	Roles for RNA binding proteins in regulating alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the central nervous system
•	Roles for alternative polyadenylation (APA) in the heart (in collaboration with Prof. Thomas Preiss's group at JCSMR, ANU)

Transcriptional regulation -- in collaboration with Dr. Qi Dai's Group at Stockholm University, Sweden
•	Gene regulation by cell-type specific transcription factor networks controlling neural cell fate specification
•	Neural cell-specific transcription factor networks regulate neural stem cell self-renewal and differentiation


Epigenetics regulation -- in collaboration with Prof. Mattias Mannervik's Group at Stockholm University, Sweden
•	Investigation of the function of histone acetylation
•	Transcriptional coregulators modifying chromatin structures.

Single cell analysis in immunity -- in collaboration with A/Prof Di Yu's Group at JCSMR, ANU
