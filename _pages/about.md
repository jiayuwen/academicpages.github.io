This is the Dr. Jean Wen's Lab at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at The Australian National University.

We are a new computational biology lab  of RNA and functional genomics at the Department of Genome Sciences, The John Curtin School of Medical Research (JCSMR), ANU. My group is devoted to exploring diverse modes of gene regulatory networks, both post-transcriptional gene regulation by small RNAs, structural RNAs, and RNA binding proteins, and transcriptional regulation by transcription factors. These regulatory elements regulate a majority of animal transcripts and exert profound control of development and physiology. Thus, their dysfunction has enormous implications in diverse human disease mechanisms. We are particular interested in understanding how these regulatory elements are made, how they evolve, how they regulate their target gene expression, and what biological impact they have on animal development and disease. We work on organisms ranging from insects to vertebrates.Â
